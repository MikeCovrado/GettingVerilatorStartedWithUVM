# GettingVerilatorStartedWithUVM
This is a somewhat modified version of the source code for "Getting Started with UVM", a textbook by Vanessa Cooper of Verilab.
Sources fetched from the Verilab webpage at https://www.verilab.com/post/getting-started-with-uvm-book on 2023-08-24.
The goal of this repo is to create a simple, yet complete and realistic, UVM environment and get it compiling and running with Verilator.

> [!NOTE]
> This repo will be updated each time Verilator announces a new release.
> The current cadence of releases is approximately two months.

## Current status
0. Success!  Currently compiles and executes with Verilator v5.040 on Ubuntu 24.04!
1. Anything that is known to be not currently supported by Verilator is excluded with conditional compilation macros:
```
`ifdef VERILATOR
  // code that is not supported by Verilator...
`else
  // temporary work-around
`endif
```
2. Compiles with zero errors (subject to a rather long list of disabled warnings).
3. Successful execution of the `data0_test`:
```

```

## Try it yourself!
1. Install the latest version of Verilator.  See https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html for details.
2. Create a shell environment variable `ANTMICRO` to point to where you would like you clone of the UVM library to be:
```
$ git clone -b current-patches-deprecated-api https://github.com/antmicro/uvm-verilator.git $ANTMICRO/current-patches-deprecated-api
```

3. Edit the (somewhat brain-dead) run-script to point a shell environment variable `UVM_HOME` to point to the above:
```
$ vim scripts/run_verilator.sh
>>> export UVM_HOME="$ANTMICRO/current-patches-deprecated-api/src"
```

4. Run it!
```
$ cd scripts
$ ./run_verilator.sh data0_test
```

## Future Work
1. Clean up all those `UVM_WARNING @ 0: reporter [UVM/COMP/NAME]` warnings.
2. Ensure both `data0_test` and `data1_test` are doing what they _should_ be doing.
3. Remove any existing `ifdef VERILATOR` work-arounds.
4. Start pushing advanced randomization of stimulus.
