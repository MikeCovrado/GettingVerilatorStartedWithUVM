# GettingVerilatorStartedWithUVM
This is a somewhat modified version of the source code for "Getting Started with UVM", a textbook by Vanessa Cooper of Verilab.
The goal of this repo is to create the simpliest possible, yet complete and realistic, UVM environment and get it compiling and running with Verilator.
